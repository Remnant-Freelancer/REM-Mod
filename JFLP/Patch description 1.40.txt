Summary
This package contains the patches for Freelancer that were earlier released under the name Unofficial FL SP patch 1.1 and 1.2. Improved some of the patches and added some others. 

Some time after the release of patch 1.2,  the SDK 1.3 was released and many Freelancers started using the SDK 1.3 ini files, which is good.
But by using the SDK 1.3 files the majority of  the Unofficial patches were no longer available. This package gives you the opportunity to have them both, because all patches are implemented on SDK 1.3 ini files.
This package would not have been possible without:
* Louva-Deus for giving us his SDK 1.3 ini package.
* Support and contributions from Crabtree and members of the WTS-team.
* Bakedpotato for linking me with Crabtree. 

Why is this not offered in FLMM-format?
Well the reason is in the nature of the patch, it corrects errors. This package repairs from my point of view bugs that in the ideal world Microsoft and/or Digital Anvil "should" have corrected before or after releasing the game. They are minor bugs but still errors. The patch does not create anything new and it does not really add anything, it just repairs and makes available what already was there. 
Warning. The package normally will not interfere with mods, but some mods use scripts to change your files. If a mod uses a script in a file that is patched, it may fail to load if it is trying to change the patched area in that file. Although the risk is very low because the patches are in code area's that are normally not subjected to modding, great efforts have been made to apply the patches in a way that this risk is reduced to the absolute minimum.

What does the Unofficial FL SP 1.4 package do?
The packages contains all the SDK 1.3 files and the credits for that go to Louva-Deus. All patches are performed on SDK 1.3 files. In this way you don't have to merge SDK 1.3 and the Unofficial FL SP 1.4 patch files yourself. It is all-in-one.
The patched "errors":
* Shipwrecks not delivering the correct loot
* Unknown objects not having their id or wrong id
* Missing reputations.
* Wrong run by references.
* Wrong local_faction
* Lacking radiation warnings
* Locked Jumpholes. Some of the jumpholes remain locked after finishing the game.
* Roid_miners only visible when in range <= 2000
* Some minor bini errors still present
* Restored the original compressed engine_good.ini. The bini version causes problems for some servers.
* Navmap related
- Asteroid fields and/or clouds not visible
- Jumpholes not visible
- Mineable area's not or not correctly displayed
- Missing names.
- Missing reputations
- Objects not on Navmap
- No information. Some objects or area's had no Ids-info (?). 
- Mine fields not visible.
- Mineable aera's displaying the mineable resource
- Visibility clouds on Navmap. Some black clouds were hardly or not visible on the Navmap. I altered their fog_colour settings slightly to make them better visible.
- Hazardous area's reveal themselves when the cursor is over them on the Navmap.
All repairs to the above mentioned are based on in dept studying the Namesresources.dll, Infocards.dll and all other FL files.

What does the Unofficial FL SP 1.4 package NOT do?
* Roid_miners. In Universe.ini, in the systemfolder and in some of the system ini-files there are code-lines that suggest that these miners are a kind of bases. Likely this is a leftover of the intention to have miners to be dockable. There are also some rooms declared for these miners. So far I have not found a miner where I could actually dock. In principle all these lines are obsolete and could be removed. I left them alone.
I have not done any work on getting the miners to be dockable. Simply because there is absolutely nothing happening there and making things happening there would be modding and that is not what my patches are about. Furthermore, there are more than enough places in unmodded and modded Sirius where you can dock and where things are happening.
* In all systems where robotbodies are used the following lines are present:
space_costume = , robot_body_A or space_costume = , robot_body_B
With other characters the syntax is space_costume = head, body. But since robots have their heads already attached to their bodies, a head does not need to be declared.
The point/question is: should not be the syntax space_costume = 0, robot_body_A?
Apparently having the head not declared does not seem to course any errors, at least I have not noticed it. Actually it seems that adding the 0 will cause problems for servers, according feedback from Crabtree. So- we left it the way it is in the SDK 1.3 files.

How to install the Unofficial FL SP 1.4 package?
Backup first!!! Close all mods before patching!!!.
The package is a zip file. The zip was created with the option "save full path info" on. So when you unzip the package all files will unzip in a Freelancer folder structure. 
To be on the safe side unzip the Unofficial FL SP package into a temporary directory so that you don't accidently overwrite files you did not want to loose and you will be able to see what exactly needs to be backed up. Then copy the Data and the EXE directory to your Freelancer directory. This way your old files will be replaced with the patched files. Make sure contents of  "Tmp-folder"\Data are copied in Freelancer\Data and contents of  "Tmp-folder"\Exe are copied in Freelancer\Exe.

Be aware that:
* Most of the patches are effective directly after restarting Freelancer and reloading your current game. And remember, to make the changes appear on your Navmap, you'll have to visit the place. 
* However, some of the patches especially where clouds, asteroids and/or mineable area's are involved, the changes only become noticeable when starting a complete new game. This is due to flags that are set in your savegame file. If you don't want to start a new game: For those who are familiar with editing of savegame fl files, at the end of the detailed document there is a rough description of  the workaround I use to find out what needs to changed in .fl visit = code lines to get the desired result.
* Some errors are still there. Simply because I have not come across them yet or due to the fact that at the time I could not find a proper solution for it or the solution was to complex.

All modders are encouraged to use this package. You allowed to use it as a whole or parts in your mods. If you've already edited system files in place, the detailed information makes it every easy to patch your own system files on the fly. 

See you in Sirius

* Ew02.ini in the folder \Data\Universe\Systems\Ew02\
1.	Patches made in Ew02.ini to make asteroid fields and/or clouds visible on Navmap.
The cloud in the Ew02 system was not visible. In this system the cloud and the asteroid field were not declared separately as elsewhere. Trying to make the cloud visible by changing only the property flag in the nebula was not succesfull. Changing the flag from 17410, which is 16378 (cloud) + 1026 (asteroid) into 33794 which represents 32768 (cloud) and 1026 (asteroid) didn't bring the desired result. 
Declaring the asteroid field separately did solve the problem.
1.	[Asteroids] - file = solar\asteroids\Ew02_nomad_asteroids.ini, changed zone = Zone_Ew02_edge_nebula into zone = Zone_Ew02_edge_asteroid

sort = 1

* Ew03.ini in the folder \Data\Universe\Systems\Ew03\
1.	Patch made in Ew03.ini to make the minefields visible on Navmap:
The minefields in the Omega-41 system are not visible on the Navmap for 3 reasons:
* The minefields are declared before the Planetary Fragments field
* The property flag was 82
* Visit flag is set to 128
The following patches were made in the Ew03.ini file:
* The [zone] - nickname = Zone_Ew03_northeast_minefield part and the [zone] - nickname = Zone_Ew03_west_minefield part were placed directly after the [zone] - nickname = Zone_Ew03_planetary_fragments part
* [zone] - nickname = Zone_Ew03_northeast_minefield changed property_flags = 82 into 4128
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Ew03_west_minefield changed property_flags = 82 into 4128

[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Schwefelwolke - visit = 36 changed in 32
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Schwefelwolke_asteroids - visit = 128 changed in 0

2.	Patches made in Rh05.ini to make asteroid fields or clouds visible on Navmap:
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Daumann_feld - visit = 128 changed in 0

3.	Patches made in Rh05.ini to display hazardous areas on Navmap when the cursor is over them:
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Schlectewolke_east_acid_pocket, added ids_name = 261348
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Schlectewolke_south_acid_pocket, added ids_name = 261348
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Schlectewolke_se_acid_pocket, added ids_name = 261348
	Note : Although the information on the Schlechtewolke suggests that damage is coursed by an acid environment, Freelancer treats it as a radiation hazard.

4.	Patch made in Rh05.ini in order to make the mineable resource known on the Nav map. The commodity ids_info reference for the resources was added to the zone. With cursor on the area, the ? symbol will now display the resource that can be mined in the area.
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Kruger_diamonds, added ids_info = 65893
[zone] - nickname = Zone_Rh05_Daumann_cobalt_mining_area, added ids_info = 65889

[CollisionGroup] - dmg_hp = DpPort _arm rotator changed in dmg_hp = DpPort_arm_rotator
The suggestion that this is an bini error seems to be confirmed by the Ku_elite 3db and sur files
in the Ku_elite ship folder.

* Solararch.ini in the folder \Data\Solar\
1.	Patch made in Solararch.ini as a part of the BW05 - Sigma-13 patch regarding the Old Kurger Storage Depot surprise. It will now display as a surprise on Navmap (red cross).

5.	Patch made in Solararch.ini to make nodock Jumpgates appear on the navmap and allow their name to be presented on the navmap. 
[Solar] - nickname = jumpgate_nodock, type = SATELLITE changed in type = JUMP_GATE

6.	Patch made in Solararch.ini to make roid_miners appear in space earlier than they do right now. 
Apparently only 4 LOD ranges are present in the roid_miners 3D files. This makes the roid_miner appear when in range 2000, while it should already appear at range 12000. The way to solve this problem would be to add an additonal LOD to the 3D files of the roid_miners. Untill that is done a good workaround alternative is to change the roid_miners LOD ranges in the Solararch.ini which gives the desired results also.
[Solar] - nickname = Roid_Miner, LODranges = 0, 750, 1300, 2000, 12000 changed in LODranges = 0, 750, 2000, 12000
[Solar] - nickname = Roid_Miner2, LODranges = 0, 750, 1300, 2000, 12000 changed in LODranges = 0, 750, 2000, 12000

Workaround - editing savegame files to get new visit = code lines
* Exit Freelancer
* Install the new system files.
* Restart Freelancer
* Fly to a base close to the area/object that is not yet displayed correctly. 
* Save the game. 
* Save the game again but under a different name.
* Delete all visit = xxxxxxxxxxx,xx from the 2nd savegame file.
* Load the edited savegame file.
* Enter space and fly to the area/object.
* As soon as the area appears on the Navmap and looks ok, turnaround and dock.
* Save the game.
* Compare the new visit = with visit = in the first savegame. This will give you the difference(s).
* Example:
* Entry in 1st savegame: visit = 3155450887, 45 (area is displayed as being mineable)
* Entry in 2nd savegame: visit = 3155450887, 41 (area is displayed as being nonmineable)
