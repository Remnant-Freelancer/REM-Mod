This is a list of mods that have problems with JFLP.  Of course, I've only
tested those I have (using FLMM v1.5 beta 1 and default options), so it's by no
means definitive, but it should at least tell you what problems you may
encounter.  This has not been updated for v1.20, so new incompatibilities may
exist.

"Title" is the name that shows up in the list of mods; "Path" is the directory
within the mods folder; "JFLPMOD" indicates that jflpmod.exe should be run
first; "Additional" then describes extra changes that need to be made, if any.
